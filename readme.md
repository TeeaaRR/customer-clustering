## **Introduction**

Customer Clustering is a process of grouping customers based on the characteristics they have. Thus, customers can be grouped into several groups that have the same characteristics.

## **Dataset**

The dataset contains 8 columns and 2000 rows. The columns are contains

- ID : id Pelanggan

## **Clustering**

The model used in this project is K-Means Clustering. To know how we found the best model, go to our [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-_DDKFvqFVz6FHV-eHy59Cj-06iWkt28?usp=sharing#scrollTo=Qt3gbMz5O-qk)
